                    <p>For about a month or two, I have been searching for a static site generator to power my site. I bought <a href="http://dirienzo.co">dirienzo.co</a> around February, maybe, and I figured with the new identity, a new way of blogging was needed. Yes, it sounds unnecessary, but it happened. I have been blogging on-and-off through a few mediums: my homegrown dynamic version on App Engine, then Blogger, then Octopress, and now Chisel.</p>
<p>I was first intrigued by static site generators when I stumbled upon Jekyll. I didn't know Ruby (and I still don't), so that was not something I was too interested in toying with. I found out about Octopress before last summer, and that was great, mainly because I was lazy and didn't want to put any effort into setup. Now, I feel that it's too large with too many options, and I wanted to have much finer control over the system. I haven't really cared to write anything in a long time (since August 2012), but after this academic year, I've decided I need to start blogging again. I plan on writing about anything and everything that comes to mind. I hope it will be interesting.</p>
<p>Before I go into Chisel, I want to talk a bit about why it took me so long to find a static site generator. My requirements weren't long at all, but for some reason, every popular system fell through for me. I wanted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Something lightweight</li>
<li>Something that templated with Jinja2</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all. And I kept seeing the same names over and over again: Hyde, Pelican, Wok, Blogofile. Hyde required Django, and I felt that it was too large for its purpose. Pelican, I think, the only gripe I had was that the templates were stored outside of the blog directory. And I can't remember why I went against Wok. And Blogofile used Mako, so that didn't even fit my requirements. Then as I stumble upon this awesome, tiny utiliy called Chisel.</p>
<p>With all of my searching, I probably should have just written a tool on my own because it would have saved me hours. I just felt that there was something out there that was written, but when I found it, I actually ended up adding more features and changing it more than I planned. The <a href="https://github.com/dz/chisel">original Chisel</a> just converted a directory of Markdown files and sent them on their way to an export directory. I think that's great, but I wanted a bit more. I wanted to be able to easily preview my changes and posts, so I brought <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html">SimpleHTTPServer</a> into the mix. Then I wanted didn't want to dive into the posts directory to create a new one, so I automated that with a command line argument. I did not really want to rely on external libraries, but I used <a href="https://github.com/un33k/python-slugify">python-slugify</a> for creating URLs. </p>
