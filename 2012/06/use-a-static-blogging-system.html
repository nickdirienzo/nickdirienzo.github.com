                    <p>I know I said I would make the switch yesterday. And I know I said I would write up a post about my first week at Google. But, I had a busy Saturday with friends, so I just pushed it back a day. No big deal. </p>
<p>I apologize about switching between three different blogging platforms within three days. I've been saying I am going to blog more this summer, since I have some interesting topics to talk about now. However, I could not have relied on my custom engine because there was a lack of metadata and features, and I didn't want to iterate on it more right now; Blogger didn't allow me to have fine grain control, so that was also out. I wanted a rock solid system, so I searched for one.</p>
<p>I hunted around, and came across this <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3414277">Ask HN</a> question. The <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3415061">top rated comment</a> said to move away from the notion of a blogging platform and switch to a static blogging system. He recommended <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, which this site is now powered by!</p>
<p>It was really easy to get up and running. The setup documentation was spot on, but the only annoyance I had was providing my <code>read/write url</code> for my repo. Turns out, it's just <code>git@github.com:username/username.github.com.git.</code> </p>
<p>Once you have it all configured, you just run <code>rake generate</code> then <code>rake deploy</code>. Since this is a "blogging framework for hackers," you should also be on top of pushing to source. </p>
<p>I'll summarize my week later today in a different post. Sorry to keep you waiting. :)</p>
