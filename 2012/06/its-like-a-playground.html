                    <p>The Googleplex definitely makes me feel like I'm at a playground, but for engineers. It's not your typical playground with swings and slides, but the campus does not give a restrictive corporate vibe (and it might have slides). There's so much going on, and there's so many neat little nuances about each building that I don't feel like I'm at a headquarters. That's the whole point of it too, I think; make it fun, so you don't want to leave. </p>
<p>There's been days where I just don't want to leave either. It's not because I have so much work to do that I can't, but because of how much there is to learn and do on campus. This past week was my second week (and my last week of orientation), and it was even more fun than my first week. You're probably thinking, "How are you having fun? Aren't you supposed to be working?" Well, yeah. I am. It's fun. On top of work though, there's so many things to do on campus to take a mental break from coding. </p>
<p>As a FEP intern, we are assigned two co-host engineers and one mentor, who is another resource and contact. Monday, I had lunch with my mentor; he's a really awesome guy, who works on the Search team. We chatted about Silicon Valley, college, Google, and life. I'm going to be trying to get lunch with him once a week. </p>
<p>Google brings authors on campus to speak about their upcoming book releases. I missed one on education that I really wish I attended, but I went to one on Tuesday on <a href="http://www.josephstiglitz.com/">Joseph Stiglitz's</a> new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Price-Inequality-Divided-Society-Endangers/dp/0393088693/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337877574&amp;sr=1-1">The Price of Inequality</a>. He discussed how America's split society is causing harm for our future. I felt that it was more of a promotional talk than an eye-opening lecture. It seems like an interesting read, at least.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, I had lunch with two of three other FEP interns on my team and our two co-hosts. We discussed the two projects that our group will be completing over the course of our internship. I will be developing internal tools to automate testing for our team along with another intern.</p>
<p>If you intern in the Bay Area, you probably hear about all these awesome events that companies throw for their interns. Google had a pretty awesome event for us after lunch on Wednesday. It was a good break. I rode a mechanical bull, for the first time in my life. Hats off to those rodeo cowboys that ride real ones. Anyway, there was also a photo contest, where two of my friends (and FEP iterns), <a href="http://peetahzee.com/">Peter Zhang</a> and <a href="http://zalcorn.com">Zach Alcorn</a>, and I were runners up for these awesome stop action shots:</p>

<p>We should have won. Anyway, I won this awesome watch!</p>

<p>On Thursday, I went white water rafting in the <a href="http://www.theamericanriver.com/">American River</a> with the Ads team. I never went rafting before, so I took the easy South Fork. We went through class one, two, and three rapids. I was with other FEP interns and one of the other intern's co-host. We want to go back to raft on the class four rapids on the Middle Frok; hopefully we can do that before August!</p>
<p>Phew, now we're on Friday. There was an orientation on Privacy, and Google really respects user data. The number one rule is that the data belongs to the user, and what we do with the data should be explicit in the policy and it should benefit the user. There was also TGIF as usual. Google IO is going to be awesome, wish I was going.</p>
<p>So this was a crazy fast week for me, and I think it's only going to get faster. I'll try to be more on top of blogging though this week. </p>
