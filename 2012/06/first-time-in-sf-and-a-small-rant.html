                    <p>Yesterday, I explored a small part of San Francisco with some of the other FEP interns. </p>
<p>It was quite an adventure just to get up to the city because we continually delayed when we would take the <a href="http://www.caltrain.com/">Caltrain</a>. The day before we decided we would take a train around noon up, but that ended up being pushed to a 3:17 departure from Mountain View's station. Actually, we never took that train because we couldn't park our cars overnight in the lot, so we ended up packing into two cars and driving up. It was an easy ride, and we stopped at <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/">In-N-Out</a> in Palo Alto. As much as you want to eat a Double Double with Animal Fries, you shouldn't. It tastes fine, but you can tell it's not healthy for you.</p>
<p>Anyway, we decided to go to <a href="http://www.fishermanswharf.org/">Fisherman's Wharf</a>, and look around. Pretty much be a tourist. We ended up at <a href="http://www.pier39.com/">Pier 39</a>, where we saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatraz_Island">Alcatraz Island</a> and the <a href="http://goldengatebridge.org/">Golden Gate Bridge</a>. I was also called a "hipster dude" by one of the pier's entertainers; I don't remember his name, but he plays with fire and balloon animals, and is quite hilarious. I got a picture with him, which once my friend uploads it, I'll add it here (hopefully I remember). </p>
<p>I even recorded most of this entertainer's act, but because of that, my phone died way before we returned home. I was talking with <a href="http://www.zachalcorn.com/">Zach Alcorn</a> about this because his phone also was dead. We wanted to take more pictures, and check-in to wherever, but we couldn't. The Internet wants us to be more social, but it's hard when battery life of phones is so limited. I don't think I was asking too much of my phone because I was automatically syncing every photo I took or had my GPS on. I took around a dozen photos, and fifteen minutes of video. Then, my phone died. Okay, I have to admit that my phone wasn't fully charged when I arrived in the city because I was checking my email, and reading <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> during the car ride. Still, a few hours of use, and the phone is no longer usable. </p>
<p>More than just being social on the go, we are reliant on our smartphones for navigation and finding information. We were trying to figure out San Francisco's public transportation system using Google Maps, and later, we were trying to find places to eat. How can we do all of this when our phones can only be active for a few hours?</p>
<p>I tend to pick my mobile gadgets by battery life, but with phone options, the best battery life isn't the most feature-packed phone. I didn't really want to compromise, so I went with the <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/">Galaxy Nexus</a> because it was the only phone with <a href="http://www.android.com/about/ice-cream-sandwich/">Android 4.0</a> at the time. It's an awesome phone, but battery life sometimes gets in the way of using it. It's not just this smartphone though. As we try to make our smartphones more and more powerful, we diminish active usage time. Should we be making this trade-off? </p>
<p>It would be beneficial to have a phone last for the entire day. By the entire day, I mean from when I wake up from when I go to bed. I'm not even asking for a full twenty-four hours (but that would be awesome). Honestly, I sometimes miss being able to go five days without having to charge my phone. The only downside to those older phones was this lack of features we see in today's smartphones. It would be awesome to see that multiple day battery life with today's feature-filled phones.</p>
<p>I know I'm not the first one to make mention of this. So, I know longer lasting phones must be on the way. I don't know for sure, but I definitely hope so.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of me ranting. Here's the <a href="http://goo.gl/nuHeS">album from today</a>.</p>
