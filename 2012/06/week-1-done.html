                    <p>I started Tuesday, and tomorrow starts up a brand new work week. I wanted to write a little about what I did, and some of my thoughts going through an average day of a first year intern at Google. Unfortunately, I don't have any pictures. Maybe I'll start taking them soon. </p>
<p>So, I already have a post about orientation. That was Tuesday. Summarizing: food, <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromebook-samsung-550.html">Samsung Series 5 Chromebook</a> (wasn't mentioned originally), Google schwag, more food, and an awesome day. </p>
<p>The following days were getting acquainted with Google's internal tools, and learning about the company. I guess that's how it works at most other companies. I'm not sure, since this is my first exposure to the "real world". I learned about Google's technologies, and business. It is really humbling to sit in a room packed with interns from not only Mountain View, but other offices as well. </p>
<p>As a FEP intern, I have two co-host engineers. They are very talented, and very passionate about the product they are working on. </p>
<p>That's a really cool thing about this company. It mothers a bunch of mini-startups. At a startup, the people are really passionate about the product, and how it will change the industry. At Google, it's the same thing. You have a handful of engineers working on a specific project, and you have managers and execs. One of my hosts said that every one on the team is a visionary, and every one can have an impact on the product. That was said at the end of the day Thursday.</p>
<p>I was really excited for Friday. I had a class where an engineer gave us the dos and don'ts for coding at Google. Then, I had lunch with the other FEP interns and our awesome recruiter. By the time lunch was over, it was 1, which meant that there was only three more hours until <a href="http://www.google.com/about/company/facts/culture/">TGIF</a>! I worked on more labs to better understand Google's developer workflow and internal tools, and then it was time to put the Noogler beanie on and head to Building 40.</p>
<p>Okay, I can't really talk about TGIF. However, it's awesome. </p>
<p>After TGIF, the other FEP interns and I left to start our weekend. We played Ultimate (of course), and I met a SWE intern. He's doing some pretty cool stuff. </p>
<p>As for the weekend, I expanded my culinary culture thanks to my friends. I had Thai and Indian foods for the first time ever, and they were excellent meals. I had Thai at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/siam-fine-thai-cuisine-san-jose">Siam Fine Thai Cuisine</a> with the FEP interns, and I had Indian the following night at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/mezbaan-santa-clara">Mezbaan Bar and Indian Cuisine</a> with a roommate and his friend. I recommend both of these places.</p>
<p>With that I think my week (and weekend) was summed up. Feel free to start a discussion below. Cheers.</p>
