                    <p>Google is known for treating their employees very well. During my first official day at Google, I can say that it is very true.</p>
<p>I'm not going to discuss the entire orientation because I don't want to take away any of its magic for first time interns. On that note, if the opportunity to intern at Google is offered, you should definitely considering accepting.</p>
<p>After receiving my temporary employee badge, I ate breakfast with the other FEP interns. The multiple posts online talking about how Google's food is fantastic, well, those are true too. In a cafeteria filled with probably one hundred or more Nooglers and Googlers, it wasn't hard to strike up conversation. We met interns from Massachusetts, Scotland, and pretty much anywhere else you can think of. At the conclusion of breakfast, we moved into a room with the famous Noogler beanies and some other goodies on tables we were to sit at. If you don't know what the Noogler beanie is, here's a picture of mine:</p>
<p><img alt="Noogler Beanie" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dnKQ56gD4nY/T87uDvNfetI/AAAAAAAAAzY/xiRgCKP3ysQ/s400/IMG_20120605_224106.jpg" /></p>
<p>Different departments presented to this year's interns on various topics, mainly on the company's policies and internal technologies that are used daily by Googlers. At some point between talks, I had to fill out some legal paperwork. It was so... much... fun. Anyway, once all the talks were over, I meandered to the nearest cafeteria. I'm not even sure where I ate, and honestly, I don't even think I know what I ate. It tasted good though.</p>
<p>After lunch, the FEP interns met up with our recruiter. He discussed the program, and what was expected of us. Even though we are to work full time, Google does want us to have fun and enjoy our time in the Valley. I know I plan to make the most it.</p>
<p>After our meeting, the FEP interns working in my area of the Ads team were escorted by the host engineers to their, well now, our building. There was a ball pit. I wish I had a picture to prove this, but I swear to you, there was a ball pit. The Googleplex is a playground for engineers. I absolutely love this place.</p>
<p>But I digress, there are eight FEP interns in this specific team in Ads; until later this month, only seven of the eight are present. We walk over to a cube and there's twelve monitors. Two per machine. I walk around, and my name is nowhere to be found. I ask my co-host, and it turns out I am across the hall in a room with two engineers and the FEP intern who will be arriving later this month. Works for me; I just need headphones and music to get in the zone anyway.</p>
<p>One of the FEP interns, <a href="https://luke.faraone.cc/">Luke Faraone</a>, tells me that we can upgrade our machines to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goobuntu">Goobuntu</a> 12.04 from 10.04. As we wait for the install to complete, we head on over to the nearest Tech Stop, Google's tech support desk. It's not a help desk. Don't call it that. They don't like that.</p>
<p>When we got back from our little adventure, we had a team meeting with our co-host engineer to learn a little more about the project and our responsibilities. By the sound of it, I'll be learning a lot and this summer will be absolutely awesome!</p>
<p>Speaking of awesome, I dropped <a href="http://unity.ubuntu.com/">Unity</a> for <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">awesome</a> on my newly upgraded machine. Before arriving on campus, I knew I had to efficiently make use of my large screen real estate. Of course, a tiling window manager was to be used. I was going to use <a href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a>, but Luke has been using awesome, so I just took his suggestion. He helped me get quickly acquainted with moving around and such, and I spent about an hour committing actions to memory and reading up on more commands. Thanks, Luke.</p>
<p>I finished my day up at Charlie's cafe. I took the GBus back to my apartment with other FEP interns and one of my roommates. And now, here I am: reflecting on my first day as a Googler. Here's to a great summer!</p>
