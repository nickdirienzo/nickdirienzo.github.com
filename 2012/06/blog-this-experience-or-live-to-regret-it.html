<p><img alt="@nickdirienzo good luck! Blog this experience, or live to regret it." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KGBEf3RW5AI/T8rx72LBHtI/AAAAAAAAAzE/a1Q5TjCP9Xo/s800/Screen%2520Shot%25202012-06-02%2520at%252010.10.14%2520PM.png" /></p>
<p>I have been meaning to blog more because I've been doing some interesting things at school, but I just never sat down and wrote about them. I am probably going to do some hindsight posts over the summer: about UB Hacking, research, coursework, and general thoughts. I'm going to change that this summer.</p>
<p>So, here's an update: I'm a <a href="http://www.google.com/jobs/engpracticum/fep/">Freshman Engineering Practicum Intern</a> at Google. Better yet, I'm interning out of the Mountain View office, the Googleplex.</p>
<p>Anyway, I really like the idea of writing your thoughts down and having a written record of life. I can't remember everything I do or see, so this is definitely a good outlet for my thoughts. I updated the site over my Spring semester to encourage my blogging habits, but for whatever reason, I still only had one past from that semester.</p>
<p>It's odd; growing up, making decisions and living, essentially, on your own. Yesterday was supposed to be the day I was to take my second flight alone, and my first flight across the country. That didn't happen.</p>
<p>Due to weather, my connecting airport from Buffalo had a ground stop, and there wasn't much notice to the passengers of the flight. I was expecting to board a plane at 2PM EST, but that was pushed to 3:30PM. 45 minutes later we were asked to go back into the airport, and lines formed at the gate counter. In a situation like this, the lines really don't move because the attendent is trying to get updates to passengers when the flight will leave, and at the same time, assist passengers to move around to different flights. This waiting was agonizing. I called my dad, told him what I was going to do, and he told me I was making "good calls" (thanks Dad).</p>
<p>I left the line to call the travel agency, who told me to talk to the airline because they could only find a one-way to San Francisco, but that would forfeit my flight home in August. I headed back into line, waited for ten minutes, and left to go to the ticket counter at the front of the airport. It didn't look much better there, but it was at least moving. Each customer took about twenty minutes to process, and as hard as the waiting was, it was fair that the customers got the customer service they wanted.</p>
<p>I ended up switching my flight to an early 6AM flight the following day, with a connection at Newark. I departed from New Jersey at around 8:30AM to go to San Francisco.</p>
<p>It's different here, at least in the Bay Area. In SFO, there were signs on Big Data, Symantec, and others. On my way to my apartment, I saw billboards for SugarSync, and WalmartLabs' Big Data initiative. It's really cool to see this kind of stuff out in public.</p>
<p>This summer is going to be awesome.</p>
