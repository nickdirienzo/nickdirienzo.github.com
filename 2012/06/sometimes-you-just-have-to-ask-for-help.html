                    <p>I recently watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/">The Incredibles</a> with some of the other FEP interns. I've seen this movie before, but I never considered how much emphasis is placed on teamwork. Okay, it's blatant throughout the movie. I mean, I've never really seen it applied to my life so strongly.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the movie, Mr. Incredible is greeted by his biggest fan, Buddy, while trying to stop a villain. Buddy pleads to work alongside him as a sidekick, but Mr. Incredible sternly says, "Fly home, Buddy, I work alone." Over the course of the movie, we see Mr. Incredible transform from this lone hero to a hero with not just one sidekick fighting alongside, but his entire family. </p>
<p>This past year, I felt that I worked alone a lot. I feel like academia had a bit to do with it because there were individual programming assignments, and the extra projects I did outside of the classroom (whether that be research work, or personal projects) were developed alone. There was one group project, but I just did it for the grade.</p>
<p>Now, I'm thrown in to this team-driven environment, and it's quite the change. I'm surrounded by engineers who are much more talented than I am, and some of my peers are more experienced. The latter was a wake up call; from my perspective, I thought I was pretty good, but I have a long way to go. I can't improve, though, unless I work with others who have more experience. There's no other way, and I'm really excited to be a part of such a talented team. </p>
<p>I was working on a small project to get acquainted with some of Google's internal tools. To get an idea of what my main project would be like, I was asked to write a RPC Calculator server. It was straightforward, but for whatever reason, I wasn't able to interact with it. I tried a couple of things to try and fix it, but to no avail. I couldn't Google my problem like I could in the past because it was internal. So, I asked my host. I had no idea, but I couldn't sit and linger on such a mundane problem. He came over, and without doing anything, it worked. I honestly have no idea what happened, or why it was erroring before. I was embarrassed, definitely. My host reassured me that I did the right thing, and there was nothing to be worried about. He said it was better to ask a question and resolve it in minutes, than to try to solve it on my own and waste an hour. </p>
<p>Another example that comes to mind is being assigned my first bug. It was to clean up some of our buildfiles, and change wildcards to explicit paths. When I first received the bug, I had no idea what the description was talking about. I looked around in some of the provided directories, and came up with a faint idea. I talked with my host about it, and he provided some more details and confirmed my thoughts. Looks like I'll be cleaning up some ugly code for a bit, and also work on my main task.</p>
<p>I wasn't as full of myself as Mr. Incredible was in three-quarters of the movie. I didn't wait until it was too late to ask for help. I'm only here for so long, and I might as well make the most of this excellent team surrounding me. Of course, I'm not going to pepper them with questions, but I am certainly not afraid to say something when I have nowhere to go. </p>
<p>Sometimes, you just have to ask for help. Don't be afraid or embarrassed to do so.</p>
