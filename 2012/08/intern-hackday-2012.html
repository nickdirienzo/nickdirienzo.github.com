                    <p>I got back from LinkedIn's <a href="http://hackday.linkedin.com/intern/2012/">Intern Hackday</a> about an hour ago. I haven't blogged in a while, but this is something that I need to write down. Coming out to the Bay Area has given me countless opportunities to attend hackathons, but I've only been to a couple. I attended Stripe's <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/sit-hack-and-relax">Sit Hack and Relax</a>, which I didn't blog about (oops). </p>
<p>Let's just switch gears real quick to recap on the Stripe event. It was a great social event, and I met a ton of hackers. I met this guy, whose blog I was reading while organizing <a href="http://ubhacking.com/">UB Hacking</a>. You may have heard of him because he <a href="http://alexeymk.com/">needs a web presence</a>. Alexey is a great guy, and he loves the startup scene. I also met <a href="http://luitvd.eu/">Luit van Drongelen</a>, and he helped me out on my first <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> <a href="https://github.com/nickdirienzo/profanity-heatmap">project</a>. Still working towards finishing that, but I digress. </p>
<p>Intern Hackday 2012 was, frankly, awesome. This was my first 24 hour hackathon that I have participated in, and I hacked with two friends, <a href="http://christopheryan.com/">Chris Yan</a> and <a href="http://dhruv-life.tumblr.com/">Dhruv Maheshwari</a>. We tossed around a few ideas, but eventually settled on building a platform to allow students to see where others were studying their courses as to facilitate study group creation on-the-fly. I deemed it <a href="https://github.com/nickdirienzo/stud.ly">Stud.ly</a> jokingly, but the name stuck. Unfortunately, we didn't finish it, but we demoed what we had to a small group of judges and other hackers. We received a lot of good feedback, and we do plan on pursuing this further as an open platform for students to use (thoughts as of post-hackathon).</p>
<p>Even though we didn't finish, many other teams did. I believe there were 44 submitted projects, which makes this a pretty massive event. My roommate, David Kim, and his team created this awesome Google+ Hangout app called <a href="https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_?gid=910889931513">StreetView +You</a>, which lets you control the view via face recognition. </p>
<p>Sitting through the finalists' demos makes me want to try even harder to improve my skills and general creativity. The winning team, for example, brought the concept of cutting out snippets from the newspaper to the web. Another team created this service called Bling Beats, which takes the social playlist functionality of the Nexus Q and brings it to the web via the Grooveshark API. Another project I want to highlight is the Typing Pattern Authentication Tool, which uses your typing style as a security layer for your online sessions. </p>
<p>Besides the projects, the hackathon was greatly organized and kept on schedule. The food was great, and the environment allowed for you to focus on your project. I took some mental notes as to improve UB Hacking's organization. Anyway, hats off to the LinkedIn Intern Hackday 2012 organizers and volunteers! Great job!</p>
