I recently watched [The Incredibles](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/) with some of the other FEP interns. I've seen this movie before, but I never considered how much emphasis is placed on teamwork. Okay, it's blatant throughout the movie. I mean, I've never really seen it applied to my life so strongly.

 In the beginning of the movie, Mr. Incredible is greeted by his biggest fan, Buddy, while trying to stop a villain. Buddy pleads to work alongside him as a sidekick, but Mr. Incredible sternly says, "Fly home, Buddy, I work alone." Over the course of the movie, we see Mr. Incredible transform from this lone hero to a hero with not just one sidekick fighting alongside, but his entire family. 

 This past year, I felt that I worked alone a lot. I feel like academia had a bit to do with it because there were individual programming assignments, and the extra projects I did outside of the classroom (whether that be research work, or personal projects) were developed alone. There was one group project, but I just did it for the grade.

 Now, I'm thrown in to this team-driven environment, and it's quite the change. I'm surrounded by engineers who are much more talented than I am, and some of my peers are more experienced. The latter was a wake up call; from my perspective, I thought I was pretty good, but I have a long way to go. I can't improve, though, unless I work with others who have more experience. There's no other way, and I'm really excited to be a part of such a talented team. 

 I was working on a small project to get acquainted with some of Google's internal tools. To get an idea of what my main project would be like, I was asked to write a RPC Calculator server. It was straightforward, but for whatever reason, I wasn't able to interact with it. I tried a couple of things to try and fix it, but to no avail. I couldn't Google my problem like I could in the past because it was internal. So, I asked my host. I had no idea, but I couldn't sit and linger on such a mundane problem. He came over, and without doing anything, it worked. I honestly have no idea what happened, or why it was erroring before. I was embarrassed, definitely. My host reassured me that I did the right thing, and there was nothing to be worried about. He said it was better to ask a question and resolve it in minutes, than to try to solve it on my own and waste an hour. 

 Another example that comes to mind is being assigned my first bug. It was to clean up some of our buildfiles, and change wildcards to explicit paths. When I first received the bug, I had no idea what the description was talking about. I looked around in some of the provided directories, and came up with a faint idea. I talked with my host about it, and he provided some more details and confirmed my thoughts. Looks like I'll be cleaning up some ugly code for a bit, and also work on my main task.

 I wasn't as full of myself as Mr. Incredible was in three-quarters of the movie. I didn't wait until it was too late to ask for help. I'm only here for so long, and I might as well make the most of this excellent team surrounding me. Of course, I'm not going to pepper them with questions, but I am certainly not afraid to say something when I have nowhere to go. 

Sometimes, you just have to ask for help. Don't be afraid or embarrassed to do so.
